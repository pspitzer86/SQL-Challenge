# SQL-Employee-Database

Using QuickDBD , pgAdmin, and Jupyter Notebook, the purpose of this project was to setup a schema for employee data split between six csvs: Departments, Dept_Employees, Dept_Managers, Employees, Salaries, and Titles.  QuickDBD was used to confirm the primary and foreign keys connecting the six csvs together.  The resulting schema was then imported into PostgresSQL to create the tables, import the csv data into the tables and then run queries based on the data.  Then by connecting the SQL database to Jupyter Notebook, Pandas and Matplotlib could be used to create histograms and bar graphs from the data after merging and reorganizing said data.
